And with our team launching sites on average of one every couple weeks this year, are we ever busy.&nbsp; We adopted Drupal on the cusp of 6 and have been incrementally making it our bitch ever since.

You are comfortable working in the modular level of Drupal&mdash;you can at the least make small tweaks via module and at best pull off custom modules of your own. You have a solid comprehension of Views and Views templates. And you have a basic knowledge in using SVN and terminal to pull latest updates. The default Drupal markup is not good enough for you. And, even though they can be huffy little divas, you view designers as a required and valuable part of the UXD process.<br />
