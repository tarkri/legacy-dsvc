"44","<p>From a young age, Eleanor drew animals. She drew them at home, she drew them in school, she drew them on vacation, in the car, when she was sick, whenever she could. She rarely drew people; there was just something special about animals that held her interest and continues to do so.</p>
<p>Eleanor rarely drew backgrounds either. She kept it simple with line work on a blank field. Sometimes she would color them in, but mostly it was the shape of the line that was the reward. She started simplifying that line and bringing more geometry into her work when she was exposed to Skateboard artwork on Alien Workshop and Habitat decks.</p>
<p>Once she started illustrating and eventually worked with Alien Workshop (a dream come true!!), she found out about <a href=\"http://www.charleyharper.com/\">Charley Harper</a>, a kindred spirit in the pursuit of simplifying animal artwork. Eleanor feels that Charley is the mentor she never knew she had! He's a hero.</p>
<p>Other design heros include Dirk Fowler, Tord Boontje, Marimekko, Lucienne Day, Ryan McGinness, Methane Studios, Jeff Kleinsmith, Sanna Annukka and so many others.</p>

"329","<p>Art-o-mat machines are retired cigarette vending machines that have been converted to vend art. Clark Whittington of Art-o-mat will bring an Art-o-mat machine and discuss the project.<br />
<br />
The inspiration for Art-o-mat&reg; came to artist Clark Whittington while observing a friend who had a Pavlovian reaction to the crinkle of cellophane. When Whittington's friend heard someone opening a snack, he had the uncontrollable urge to have one too.<br />
<br />
In 1997, Whittington used a recently-banned cigarette machine to create the first Art-o-mat. The machine sold Whittington's black &amp; white photographs. The project has grown to 85 Art-o-mat machines and over 400 contributing artists from 10 different countries. One of the machines lives here locally at <a href=\"http://www.art251.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Art251</a>!<br />
<br />
Don&rsquo;t go &lsquo;round artless! Be sure to bring an extra five dollars to interact with the Art-o-mat machine, and take home some pocket size art!<br />

"453","<p>DEC 2 &ndash; Aaron Draplin is on a mission to save graphic design from the bland apocalypse brought on by desktop publishing. His mid-western roots harken him back to a time when American designers were expert craftsman who skillfully set type and made simple, two-color illustrations with care. For the past two years he has made a pilgrimage to the <a href=\"http://www.127sale.com/\">World's Longest Yard Sale</a>, looking for relics of our great past. His <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/draplin/collections/\">collections of photos</a> from those trips show great examples of matchboxes, metal signs, tin cans, and beer labels from post-war America.&quot;The good old days.&quot;</p>
<p>Aaron does his part to make design a little better at his own shop, Draplin Design Co. in Portland Oregon. He fights the good fight for several snowboarding and winter clothing brands, along with the occasional hot dog stand, farmer, t-shirt shop, and <a href=\"http://www.modeproject.com/news/president-obama-unveils-new-logos-designed-by-mode-project/\">Presidential recovery program</a>. He also find time to share a bit of daily inspiration on <a href=\"http://www.draplin.com/\">his blog</a>, make a huge line of practical <a href=\"http://www.draplin.com/merch/\">DDC branded merch</a>, and devloped a popular band of little notepads called <a href=\"http://fieldnotesbrand.com/\">Field Notes</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to see you all there. And, DON'T FORGET, we've moved our meetings to the Magnolia Theater at West Village. If you go to City Place, you will be very lonely!</p>
